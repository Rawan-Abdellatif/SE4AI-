          <Details2 isDarkMode={isDarkMode}>
          In his talk, Patrick delved into the distinct characteristics of data
          as a digital asset and examined the challenges of striking a balance
          between data valorization and privacy. Emphasizing the importance of
          data management in large organizations, such as financial
          institutions, he addressed the emerging challenges posed by privacy
          laws and the rapid growth of AI. Through a discussion of evolving
          practices like privacy-by-design, advances in privacy engineering, and
          innovative privacy technologies such as data synthesis, he offered
          valuable insights for navigating the intricate future of data privacy
          within organizations. Furthermore, he brought to light potential
          future disruptors, such as open banking in Canada, particularly
          relevant to the finance sector.

        <Details isDarkMode={isDarkMode}>
          Patrick Mesana began his career as a software engineer, gaining
          experience with consulting companies and startups before transitioning
          into the field of Data Science. As a former manager in the Data Office
          of National Bank of Canada (NBC), Patrick encountered numerous data
          management challenges. He is currently pursuing a PhD in decision
          science to explore the tradeoffs between data privacy and data value.
          In addition, Patrick serves as a researcher and scientific lead on
          these topics for the AI Factory at NBC.

          Predictive machine learning has the ability to automate and optimize
          workflows across a wide range of industries. In this session, we will
          explore real-life examples of how predictive machine learning is being
          used at Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) and Medable. At SIE, we
          will delve into their scalable, real-time, low-latency predictive
          ML-based solutions that are implemented on the cloud in order to
          personalize purchasing and playing experiences. Medable, on the other
          hand, has implemented an automated, decentralized clinical trials
          platform on the cloud in order to greatly improve efficiency and
          accuracy. Throughout this session, we will also discuss the role of
          machine learning engineering and the exciting opportunities that lie
          ahead in this field. Overall, this session aims to provide a
          comprehensive overview of the various applications and potential of
          predictive machine learning.

            Sumon Biswas is a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Iowa State
            University (ISU) and a Research Assistant in Laboratory for Software
            Design <Img5 src={sumon_biswasImage} alt="sumon_biswas.jpg" />at ISU under the supervision of Professor Hridesh Rajan. His
            research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering,
            Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence. He has worked on
            Machine Learning (ML) software repository mining and analysis in
            large-scale using the Boa framework. He worked on building Python
            language support for Boa to analyze ML programs and Jupyter
            Notebooks. Currently, he is working in the D4 (Dependable
            Data-Driven Discovery) initiative at ISU towards increasing the
            dependability of data-driven software. Specifically, he is
            conducting research on understanding the societal bias in ML models
            and reasoning about fairness property and its mitigation in ML
            pipelines. His research results appeared in reputed software
            engineering venues including ICSE and ESEC/FSE.
